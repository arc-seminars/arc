Steps to follow for each new ARC seminar registration: 

1. Add new info file in `content/seminars/`. These can be copy pasted from a previous one. Please adhere to the naming convention :)
2. In `layouts/seminars/single.html`, change line 21 to be today's date (keep that updated so the "upcoming" seminars are always future ones and the "past" seminars are always in the past)

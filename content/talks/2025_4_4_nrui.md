White dwarfs are the compact end products of stellar evolution in the vast majority of stars.
They are highly dense Earth-sized, solar-mass objects supported by electron degeneracy pressure.
I will first describe the essential physics and phenomenology needed to understand white dwarfs.
Subject to time, I will then briefly describe the state of research into white dwarfs, which includes puzzles in magnetism, pulsations, close binarity, detonation, radio emission, and compositional evolution.

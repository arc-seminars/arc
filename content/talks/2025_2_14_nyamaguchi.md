Binary interaction is among the most important unsolved problems in stellar astrophysics.
Close white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries are the end products of mass transfer processes that occurred when the WD progenitor was a red giant, making them key tools for improving our understanding of these processes.
In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the existing literature, going into some detail about the sample of WD + MS binaries discovered using Gaia DR3, and describe a few of my completed and ongoing projects related to this.

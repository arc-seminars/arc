Black hole perturbation theory, initiated by the seminal work of Tullio Regge and John Wheeler nearly seventy years ago, has become an indispensable tool in cosmology, high energy astrophysics, and at elucidating the fundamental nature of gravity.
A series of observational breakthroughs — from nearly a decade of gravitational wave (GW) detection from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, to the imaging of the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87, to the recent detection of the stochastic GW background — has launched a renaissance in black hole physics.
In this talk, I will briefly review important historical developments and discuss the underlying mathematical structure describing linearized metric perturbations of stationary BHs both in and beyond general relativity (GR).
In particular, I will highlight some of my recent work on classifying isospectrality (a degeneracy in the spectrum of GWs) in beyond GR theories and detail some open problems.

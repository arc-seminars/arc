The ringdown phase of a binary black hole merger encodes key information about the remnant’s properties through its quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum.
Extracting these modes accurately is crucial for testing general relativity and understanding binary black hole dynamics.
In this talk, I’ll explore ringdown physics and introduce an automated algorithm for efficient QNM fitting.
I’ll discuss its application to simulated waveforms, highlighting the expected physics of asymmetric mergers and mode excitation.
These results have important implications for future observational tests of black hole structure and potential beyond-GR signatures.

I present a broad overview of extreme mass ratio inspirals with a particular focus on what makes them so challenging to model and detect.
We'll look at a range of theoretical and numerical approaches, the astrophysical population, and upcoming GW detectors poised to observe these unique systems.
I'll also discuss my own work on tidal heating, a phenomenon whose importance to late-stage, high-spin EMRIs could help us distinguish exotic compact objects from black holes.

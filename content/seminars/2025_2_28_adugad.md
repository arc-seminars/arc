I will be talking about our attempts to resolve the measurement problem by allowing the emitted/detected particles in a system to travel both forwards and backwards in time.
I will discuss the issue of causality, which may or may not be violated depending on the model.
This research is primarily influenced by the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory and John Cramer's Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics.

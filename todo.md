apply custom icon to list of tags / seminars

Make readme, with following info:
- how to download hugo (see link above)
- using hugo server (makes public/ -- do not commit this)
- don't change anything in themes/..., but you can copy things over to the same path in layouts/
- adding a new seminar: see content/seminars
- youtube string, what does [] mean
- if an announced seminar is cancelled, just set the cancelled tag to true -- don't delete the file. that will keep the page (with a "cancelled" string), but won't show it anywhere.

- git add the file, git commit -m "instructive message here", git push -u origin main

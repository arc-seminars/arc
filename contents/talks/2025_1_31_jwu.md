General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulation is one of the most important tools to study the evolution of compact objects and high-energy phenomena in the universe.
I will give an overview of the formalism of GRMHD simulations coupled to dynamical spacetime evolution, and the implementation of code.
Following this, I will talk about the current limitation of numerical simulation and possible solutions to overcome this.

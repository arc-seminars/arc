Observations from asteroseismology suggest that stellar cores rotate more slowly than predicted by standard physics.
This implies an additional mechanism of angular momentum transport, still highly uncertain.
I summarize a few key works on the problem, namely *Zahn, et al.* (1997), on transport by gravity waves, and *Fuller, et al.* (2019), on the modified Taylerâ€“Spruit instability.

Infrared emission lines are powerful probes of the physical conditions within dust-obscured regions, such as protoplanetary disks, molecular clouds, and active galactic nuclei.
In this talk I will describe the physics behind this line emission and show examples of how measurements of atomic and molecular lines have been used to help us understand the dusty ISM.
